This is for a course project on collaborative filtering algorithms. The Collaborative filtering algorithm for obtaining recommended items can be found in the file 'recommendations.py'. Similarity of items in the movie lens folder, specifically the u.item and u.data files are evaluated using popular metrics like the 'Euclidean distance' and 'Pearson's corellation coefficient', at this stage. Future work includes using the TF-IDF technique, Fast CF by k-means and the Singular Value Decomposition(SVD)-based Collaborative filtering algorithms. The algorithms are evaluated using popular metrics like Root mean square error.
